    <h1>Maps and Navigation</h1>
    <p>AI has drastically improved traveling. Instead of having to rely on printed maps or directions, you can now use Waze, Google, or Apple Maps on your phone and type in your destination.

        So how does the application know where to go? And what’s more, the optimal route, road barriers, and traffic congestions? Not too long ago, only satellite-based GPS was available, but now, artificial intelligence is being incorporated to give users a much more enhanced experience.
        
        Using machine learning, the algorithms remember the edges of the buildings that it has learned, which allows for better visuals on the map, and recognition and understanding of house and building numbers. The application has also been taught to understand and identify changes in traffic flow so that it can recommend the route that avoids roadblocks and congestion.</p>

    <h1>Search and Recommendation Algorithms</h1>
    <p>When you want to watch a movie or shop online, have you noticed that the items suggested to you are often aligned with your interests or recent searches? These smart recommendation systems have learned your behavior and interests over time by following your online activity. The data is collected at the front end (from the user) and stored and analyzed through machine learning and deep learning. It is then able to predict your preferences, usually, and offer recommendations for things you might want to buy or listen to next.

    <h1>E-Payments</h1>
    <p>Having to run to the bank for every transaction is an enormous waste of time and AI is playing a part in why you haven’t been to a bank branch in 5 years. Banks are now leveraging artificial intelligence to facilitate customers by simplifying payment processes.

        Intelligent algorithms have made it possible to make deposits, transfer money, and even open accounts from anywhere, leveraging AI for security, identity management, and privacy controls.
        
        Even potential fraud can be detected by observing users’ credit card spending patterns. This is also an example of artificial intelligence. The algorithms know what kind of products a user buys, when and from where they are typically bought, and in what price bracket they fall.
        
        When there is an unusual activity that does not fit in with the user profile, the system can generate an alert or a prompt to verify transactions.
